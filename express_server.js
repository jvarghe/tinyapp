/* M03 W06 CHALLENGE: TINY APP
 *
 *                         A NOTE TO INVIGILATORS!!!
 *
 * This application is not only intended for submission to LHL, but also as a
 * reference for future education. As a result, it has been heavily commented
 * and disused code paths have been deliberately left behind. Please bear this
 * in mind when scoring this project.
 *
 * If you are bothered by extensive commenting, you can fold all comments to a
 * single line while marking. In VS Code apply this key chord: `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+/`.
 * To unfold all comments again: `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+J`.
 *
 *
 * CHALLENGE
 *
 * This week we will start the next multi-day assignment, which will guide you
 * through creating a fully-functioning web-server and API. For this assignment,
 * we will create a URL shortening service similar to TinyURL, Bitly, or Goo.gl.
 *
 * In essence, a URL Shortener is a service that takes a regular URL and
 * transforms it into an encoded version, which redirects back to the original
 * URL. For example:
 *
 *    https://www.lighthouselabs.ca â†’ http://goo.gl/6alQXu
 *
 * In order to create a service that shortens URLs we will need to apply the
 * concepts that we learned such as HTTP redirection and APIs. Additionally,
 * we will learn new concepts including the fundamentals of web servers, what
 * purpose middleware serves, event-driven programming, and template engines.
 *
 * We will use the specific technologies to illustrate these concepts:
 *
 *     * Web Server: Node.js
 *     * Middleware: Express
 *     * Template Engine: EJS
 *
 *
 * ON THE ORDER OF ENDPOINTS
 *
 * The order of route definitions matters! The GET `/urls/new` route needs to
 * be defined before the GET `/urls/:id` route. Routes defined earlier will
 * take precedence, so if we place this route after the `/urls/:id` definition,
 * any calls to `/urls/new` will be handled by app.get("/urls/:id", ...)
 * because Express will think that `new` is a route parameter. A good rule of
 * thumb to follow is that routes should be ordered from most specific to least
 * specific.
 *
 *
 * COMPLETED ENDPOINTS FOR THE FOLLOWING ROUTES
 *
 *     * GET  /
 *     * GET  /hello
 *     * GET  /urls.json
 *
 *     * GET  /urls
 *     * GET  /urls/new
 *     * GET  /urls/:id
 *     * GET  /u/:id
 *     * GET  /login
 *     * GET  /register
 *
 *     * POST /urls/:id/delete
 *     * POST /urls
 *     * POST /login
 *     * POST /logout
 *     * POST /register

/* Add URL-Encoding Parser
 *
 * Add parser to read and parse URL-encoded data. Used mainly for HTTP requests
 * that make permanent changes like POST (also PUT and DELETE??). These requests
 * make permanent changes to persistent storage, and so they must specify such
 * changes. For some requests, they are passed in via the URL. Such data is
 * URL-encoded and must be decoded before it can be used.
 *
 * "When our browser submits a POST request, the data in the request body is
 * sent as a `Buffer`. While this data type is great for transmitting data, it's
 * not readable for us humans. To make this data readable, we will need to use
 * another piece of middleware which will translate, or parse the body. This
 * feature is part of Express."
 *
 * "The `body-parser` library will convert the request body from a `Buffer` into
 * string that we can read. It will then add the data to the `req` (request)
 * object under the key `body`. (If you find that `req.body` is `undefined`,
 * it may be that the `body-parser` middleware is not being run correctly.)
 *
 * So using [`/urls/new` form] as an example, the data in the input field will
 *  be available to us in the `req.body.longURL` variable, which we can store
 * in our `urlDatabase` object. (Later we'll store these URLs in a real
 * database, but for now we're focusing on the communication between server and
 * client.)"
