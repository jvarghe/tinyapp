/* M03 W06 CHALLENGE: TINY APP
 *
 * A NOTE TO INVIGILATORS!!!
 *
 * This application is not only intended for submission to LHL, but also as a
 * reference for future education. As a result, it has been heavily commented
 * and disused code paths have been deliberately left behind. Please bear this
 * in mind when scoring this project.
 *
 * CHALLENGE
 *
 * This week we will start the next multi-day assignment, which will guide you
 * through creating a fully-functioning web-server and API. For this assignment,
 * we will create a URL shortening service similar to TinyURL, Bitly, or Goo.gl.
 *
 * In essence, a URL Shortener is a service that takes a regular URL and
 * transforms it into an encoded version, which redirects back to the original
 * URL. For example:
 *
 *    https://www.lighthouselabs.ca â†’ http://goo.gl/6alQXu
 *
 * In order to create a service that shortens URLs we will need to apply the
 * concepts that we learned such as HTTP redirection and APIs. Additionally,
 * we will learn new concepts including the fundamentals of web servers, what
 * purpose middleware serves, event-driven programming, and template engines.
 *
 * We will use the specific technologies to illustrate these concepts:
 *
 *     * Web Server: Node.js
 *     * Middleware: Express
 *     * Template Engine: EJS
 *
 *
 * ON THE ORDER OF ENDPOINTS
 *
 * The order of route definitions matters! The GET `/urls/new` route needs to
 * be defined before the GET `/urls/:id` route. Routes defined earlier will
 * take precedence, so if we place this route after the `/urls/:id` definition,
 * any calls to `/urls/new` will be handled by app.get("/urls/:id", ...)
 * because Express will think that `new` is a route parameter. A good rule of
 * thumb to follow is that routes should be ordered from most specific to least
 * specific.
 *
 *
 * ROUTES
 *
 *     * GET  /
 *     * GET  /urls
 *     * GET  /urls/new
 *     * POST /urls
 *     * GET  /urls/:id
 *     * GET  /u/:id
 *     * POST /urls/:id/delete
 *     * POST /login

// ASSIGNMENTS

// Create an Express application.
const app = express();

// Define a default port for the project.
const PORT = 8080;

// Add EJS to the project as the template engine.
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

/* Add URL-Encoding Parser
 *
 * Add parser to read and parse URL-encoded data. Used mainly for HTTP requests
 * that make permanent changes like POST (also PUT and DELETE??). These requests
 * make permanent changes to persistent storage, and so they must specify such
 * changes. For some requests, they are passed in via the URL. Such data is
 * URL-encoded and must be decoded before it can be used.
 *
 * "When our browser submits a POST request, the data in the request body is
 * sent as a `Buffer`. While this data type is great for transmitting data, it's
 * not readable for us humans. To make this data readable, we will need to use
 * another piece of middleware which will translate, or parse the body. This
 * feature is part of Express."
 *
 * "The `body-parser` library will convert the request body from a `Buffer` into
 * string that we can read. It will then add the data to the `req` (request)
 * object under the key `body`. (If you find that `req.body` is `undefined`,
 * it may be that the `body-parser` middleware is not being run correctly.)
 *
 * So using [`/urls/new` form] as an example, the data in the input field will
 *  be available to us in the `req.body.longURL` variable, which we can store
 * in our `urlDatabase` object. (Later we'll store these URLs in a real
 * database, but for now we're focusing on the communication between server and
 * client.)"

// BOOT SERVER
// The server program launches, listens for incoming requests at the given port
// (8080), and logs a greeting to the console.
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Tiny App is listening on port ${PORT}!`);
});



// REQUEST/RESPONSE PIPELINE

// TEST ROUTES

// A default route to serve as "Hello World" to those who visit `.../`.
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello!");
});


// A test route that returns HTML in the response body to requests for
// `.../hello`.
app.get("/hello", (req, res) => {

  // `Hello World` wrapped in HTML tags.
  res.send("<html><body>Hello <b>World</b></body></html>\n");

});


// A GET request to `/urls.json` will trigger this endpoint. It will query and
// return the contents of the URL database to the client as a JSON object. Not
// user-friendly at all.
app.get("/urls.json", (req, res) => {

  // This endpoint will return the data from `urlDatabase` as a JSON file.
  // Note that the response method being used `.json()`.
  res.json(urlDatabase);

});



// MAIN ROUTE HANDLERS

// GET ENDPOINTS

/* GET `/urls/:id`. Corresponds to `.../urls/[short-URL]` [urls_show.ejs]
 *
 * Route handler for GET `/urls:id`, where `:id` stands for the short URL.
 * The `:id` value is dynamic; it will be a short 6-digit alphanumeric value
 * that looks like this: `f20Z4k`. `:id` is a route parameter.
 *
 * ROUTE PARAMETERS
 *
 * If you start the server and go to `http://localhost:8080/urls/[Short-URL]`,
 * then `Short-URL` is the value of `:id` Route Parameter. It gets passed in
 * via the URL and is added to the request body. When the request arrives at
 * the backend, Express.js loads this value into the `req.params.id` property.
 * From there, you can load it into the view, where it can be used.
 *
 *
 * TRIGGERING `/urls/:id`
 *
 * In this particular program, `:id` comes from either the URL database,
 * or is generated by POST `/urls` when the user adds a new long URL to the
 * program or updates an existing one. New URLs are created at `.../urls/new`
 * and existing ones can be updated on that page, or on `.../urls`.
 *
 * Re-directs from POST `/urls`; Shows the user their newly created short URL.
