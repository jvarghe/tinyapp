## What is Tiny App?

This is a simple URL Shortener Web Service. A user can register their own account and login to it. Once logged in, they can create, read, update and delete URLs to a simulated (non-persistent) database. When a URL is added to the database, Tiny App will create a short URL for it, which you can use in place of the full URL.

This is a CRUD/BREAD web application that implements 15 endpoints, plus helper functions.
